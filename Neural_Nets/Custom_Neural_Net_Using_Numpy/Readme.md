# Neural Network using Numpy
In this assignment, I have created a complete neural network using Numpy. I have also implemented all the steps required 
to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.
 
 
The Code is divided into the following sections:
- Data preparation
- Feedforward
- Loss computation
- Backpropagation
- Parameter updates
- Model training and predictions

The model is also been trained on MNIST dataset with handwritten digits to classify between 0~9
